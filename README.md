# Directory Files Randomizer Kotlin
Simple program that appends random numbers to each file in a given directory.

## How does it work?
This program works by generating random numbers (with the upper bound being the number of files in the current directory)
for all files in the directory set by the user. For example, let's say a folder has a file called "file1.txt". What the
program will do, is to append a random number to the file's name. Now it will be, for example, "3 - file1.txt".
By appending random numbers like this, it's possible to generate a random ordering of the files in a given directory.

**Note:** This project is a Kotlin version of the [Directory Files Randomizer](https://github.com/mathsemilio/directory-files-randomizer).
